Boundary MongoDB Plugin
=======================

The Boundary MongoDB plugin collects information on MongoDB.
**Only [MongoDB Enterprise](http://www.mongodb.com/products/mongodb-enterprise) is supported.**

The plugin requires MongoDB to have SNMP monitoring enabled, and an SNMP agent listening on a UDP socket accessible
to the plugin.  See [this article](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/monitor-with-snmp/) for instructions
on how to set up SNMP monitoring of MongoDB. 

The plugin requires Python 2.6 or later.

## Metrics

The information collected is a subset of the MongoDB MIB, which is contained in `MONGOD-MIB.txt` in the MongoDB
Enterprise package.
